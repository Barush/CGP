	Competitive Coevolution in Cartesian Genetic Programming

Bachelor's thesis on Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology


Symbolic regression is a function formula search approach dealing with isolated points of the
function in plane or space. In this thesis, the symbolic regression is performed by Cartesian
Genetic Programming and Competitive Coevolution. This task has already been resolved
by Cartesian Genetic Programming using Coevolution of Fitness Predictors. This thesis is
concerned with comparison of Coevolution of Fitness Predictors with simpler Competitive
Coevolution approach in terms of approach effort. Symbolic regression has been tested on
five functions with different complexity. It has been shown, that Competitive Coevolution
accelerates the symbolic regression task on plainer functions in comparison with Coevolution
of Fitness Predictors. However, Competitive Coevolution is not able to solve more complex
functions in which Coevolution of Fitness Predictors succeeded.
